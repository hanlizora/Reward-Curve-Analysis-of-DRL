1 Value-based MADRL
(1) The joint-reward curve increases gradually during the early episodes, but then it decreases precipitously. The following diagram shows.
Possible Reasons: 
The estimation of state-action values is not accurate.
Adjustment Methods:
Increase the action exploration (to prevent action networks from converging to inaccurate values).
Decrease the learning rate of action networks (to prevent action networks from converging to inaccurate values). 
Increase the update frequency of target networks (to prevent action networks from converging to inaccurate values).
Increase networks’ complexity (to enhance networks’ fitting ability)
